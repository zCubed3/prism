# PRISM - A CPU Renderer written in Rust

### This is purely a hobby project! If you see code you don't like or think is inefficient go ahead and tell me or just fix it yourself!
### PRISM is meant to be an experiment to make a CPU renderer in Rust while also providing a strong enough math library for ease of development

**Please consult the math library [readme](src/math/README.md) for more on the math section**
